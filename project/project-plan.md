# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
The Impact of Income Inequality and Healthcare Access on Life Expectancy in North and South America

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How do income inequality and healthcare access influence life expectancy across North and South America?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Income inequality and healthcare access are critical factors influencing population health and life expectancy. This project aims to explore the relationship between these socioeconomic factors and life expectancy across countries in North and South America. By utilizing regression analysis and statistical comparison, the project will provide insights into how income distribution and healthcare accessibility contribute to health outcomes. These insights could help inform policy on socioeconomic and healthcare reforms to address health disparities across the Americas.
